# FormWise AI: Build & Monetize Custom AI Tools Without Code, White-Label Solutions for Agencies

So you've been playing around with ChatGPT, crafting perfect prompts that actually work for your business. You're getting those magical AI responses that make your clients go "wow." And then you think: wouldn't it be cool if I could just... sell this? Like, not share a prompt on a Google Doc, but turn it into an actual branded product people can use?

<img width="3104" height="1781" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f12aa8a-b39a-44f9-af38-b41745efa32c" />

That's where FormWise AI steps in. It's basically the bridge between "I have a killer ChatGPT prompt" and "I have a monetizable AI product." No coding required, no headaches about API configurations, just your expertise wrapped in a slick interface your clients can actually use.

Let's walk through what makes this platform interesting for anyone who's tired of manually running the same AI prompts for clients over and over again.

**What FormWise Actually Does**

Think of FormWise as your AI tool factory. You know those custom GPT conversations you've perfected? The ones that generate perfect social media captions for real estate agents, or craft email sequences for coaches, or create product descriptions for eCommerce stores? FormWise lets you turn those into standalone tools that look like you hired a development team.

The platform gives you two main building blocks: SmartForms and CoPilots. SmartForms are your fill-in-the-blank style tools. Users input their information, hit submit, and get AI-generated results based on your pre-configured prompts. Think of it like a fancy form that spits out customized content. It's perfect for tasks with clear inputs and outputs, like generating blog post outlines, creating ad copy, or drafting business proposals.

CoPilots work differently. They're more like having a conversation with an AI assistant that follows your specific framework. Instead of one-and-done outputs, CoPilots guide users through a process, answer follow-up questions, and adapt based on the conversation flow. Great for coaching scenarios, troubleshooting, or any situation where the path isn't totally linear.

Both can be embedded directly into your website, client portals, or membership platforms. And here's the kicker: they carry your branding, not FormWise's. Your clients see your logo, your colors, your domain. It genuinely looks like you built custom software.

**The Real Power Move: Turning Prompts Into Products**

Here's a scenario that probably sounds familiar. You're a marketing consultant, and you've spent months perfecting your content framework. You know exactly what questions to ask clients to extract their unique value proposition. You've got ChatGPT prompts that nail it every time.

But scaling that expertise? That's the problem. You can't be in 50 client calls simultaneously walking people through your process. With FormWise, you build that process once as a SmartForm or CoPilot, and suddenly your framework becomes a 24/7 asset. Clients can access it whenever they need it, and you're not stuck repeating yourself.

People are using this in wildly different ways. Real estate agents are building property description generators. Course creators are packaging AI writing assistants for their students. Agencies are white-labeling entire toolsets for specific industries, then charging monthly subscriptions for access.

One user mentioned in the FormWise community built a low-ticket toolset for local service businesses, spent less than one hundred dollars on ads, and turned it into recurring revenue. The tools weren't rocket science. Lead response scripts, social media post generators, review reply assistants. Basic stuff, but packaged in a way that felt professional and saved business owners actual time.

**SmartForms vs CoPilots: When to Use Which**

If you're scratching your head about the difference, here's the simple version. SmartForms are transactional. User fills out form, AI generates output, done. They're fast, focused, and perfect when you know exactly what inputs you need to produce a specific result.

CoPilots are conversational. The AI acts like a consultant who's been trained on your methodology. Users can ask questions, get clarification, explore different angles. It's the difference between using a calculator versus having a tutor sit next to you.

Most successful FormWise users mix both in their toolsets. Maybe you have a SmartForm that generates initial draft content, and a CoPilot that helps users refine their brand voice. Or a SmartForm for quick social media captions, and a CoPilot for broader marketing strategy conversations.

The platform supports something called prompt chaining, which is basically linking multiple AI steps together. So your SmartForm might gather user input, generate a first draft, analyze that draft for improvements, then spit out the polished version. All happening automatically in the background.

**Pricing: What You Actually Get**

FormWise operates on subscription tiers, and as of early 2026, they've simplified things considerably by including AI credits directly in the plans. No more juggling OpenAI API keys unless you want to.

The **Pro Plan** runs at around $99 per month and is aimed at solo creators or small teams. You get 10 toolsets, unlimited SmartForms and CoPilots within those toolsets, and 5,000 AI credits monthly. That's enough juice to run several thousand AI interactions depending on complexity. The plan includes access to all OpenAI models including GPT-4o, prompt chaining, file uploads, web browsing capabilities, and the ability to gate your tools behind login walls for monetization. They even throw in a free HighLevel subaccount, which normally costs $97 monthly.

The **Agency Plan** is $229 per month and removes the toolset cap entirely. Unlimited toolsets, 10 collaborator accounts, 10,000 monthly AI credits, and native GoHighLevel integration for agencies embedding tools across client accounts. File upload limits jump from 2MB to 20MB per file, and you get advanced OpenAI configuration options. This tier is clearly designed for agencies managing multiple client brands or creators running several distinct product lines.

Annual subscriptions come with all credits upfront, so if you grab the Agency plan annually, you're looking at 120,000 credits deposited immediately. Both plans include a 7-day free trial, so you can actually build and test tools before committing.

There's also mention of an Enterprise tier with custom pricing for larger organizations, but details are sparse. Presumably, that's for companies needing white-glove support or specific compliance requirements.

Here's the pricing breakdown in a cleaner format:

| Plan | Monthly Price | AI Credits/Month | Toolsets | Collaborators | Best For |
|------|--------------|------------------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Pro Plan** | $99 | 5,000 credits | 10 toolsets | Solo | Coaches, consultants, solo creators monetizing AI tools |
| **Agency Plan** | $229 | 10,000 credits | Unlimited | 10 seats | Agencies, SaaS startups, multi-brand creators scaling across clients |

Both plans include unlimited SmartForms, unlimited CoPilots, access to all OpenAI models including GPT-4o, prompt chaining, data source uploads, web browsing, login mode monetization, and white-labeling. The Agency plan adds native GoHighLevel embedding, advanced OpenAI settings, and higher file upload limits.

If you're running a GoHighLevel agency and want to embed AI tools across all your client subaccounts without manually configuring each one, the Agency plan's native integration alone justifies the upgrade. For everyone else, the Pro plan is probably where you start.

**The Toolset Bundles: Templates That Actually Work**

One interesting move FormWise made recently is packaging pre-built toolset bundles for specific industries. Instead of starting from a blank canvas, you can grab a bundle like the eCommerce AI Toolkit and have a dozen ready-to-use tools configured for online store owners.

The eCommerce bundle includes tools for generating product descriptions, ad copy, abandoned cart emails, customer review analyzers, and more. It's designed for marketers and agencies serving eCommerce clients. You import the bundle, customize the branding and prompts to match your style, and suddenly you have a productized offering you can sell.

Similar bundles exist for course creators, real estate agents, email marketers, and other niches. Each one comes with SmartForms and CoPilots tailored to common pain points in that industry. You're not locked into using them as-is. The whole point is they give you a starting framework you can tweak rather than building everything from scratch.

**Who's Actually Using This Thing**

From what you see in testimonials and case studies, the user base skews heavily toward agencies, coaches, and consultants. People who have proprietary frameworks or methodologies they want to scale beyond one-on-one time.

Molly Mahoney, an AI coach, mentioned it helped her grow client retention by 20% because she could offer ongoing value through AI tools rather than just training sessions. Jon Schumacher, an entrepreneur, claimed he generated $200K in digital product sales by embedding AI tools into his course offerings.

Matt Deseno, CEO of HLPro Tools, uses it to create value for agency clients. The common thread is people packaging their expertise into formats that don't require their constant presence.

There's also a solid community aspect. FormWise runs a Facebook group where users share what's working, troubleshoot builds, and swap ideas. That collaborative environment seems valuable, especially when you're figuring out how to structure a new tool or price a toolset.

**The GoHighLevel Connection**

If you're in the agency world, you've probably heard of GoHighLevel. It's become the default CRM and automation platform for marketing agencies. FormWise integrates directly with GHL, which means you can embed your AI tools inside client subaccounts, trigger workflows based on tool usage, and manage everything from one dashboard.

The Pro plan gives you a free GHL subaccount. The Agency plan lets you embed tools natively across unlimited client accounts without manual configuration. For GHL agencies specifically, this is a pretty compelling value prop. You can position AI capabilities as a premium add-on to your existing services without actually building anything from scratch.

Users have reported setting up AI-powered lead response scripts, social media content generators, and customer onboarding assistants directly inside their clients' GHL portals. Clients log in to their familiar CRM and suddenly have AI superpowers embedded right there.

**Login Mode: The Monetization Piece**

Here's where things get interesting for people wanting to actually sell access to their tools. FormWise's Login Mode lets you gate toolsets behind user authentication and subscription walls. You can create free tiers, paid plans, credit-based usage models, or unlimited access subscriptions.

The platform integrates with Stripe for payments, so you can set up monthly or annual billing directly. Users create accounts, purchase a plan, and get access to your bundled tools. You control what's included in each tier, how many credits users get per month, and whether they can roll over unused credits.

This is the difference between "here's a link to my tool" and "here's my SaaS product." You're not just sharing prompts anymore. You're running a subscription business with user management, billing, and access control built in.

Several FormWise users have positioned this as adding a low-ticket productized offering to their business model. Instead of only selling high-ticket consulting or done-for-you services, they offer a $27-$97 monthly toolset subscription that provides immediate value and creates recurring revenue. Clients get self-service access to AI tools, and you're not stuck being the bottleneck.

**Data Sources and Knowledge Uploads**

One underrated feature is the ability to upload your own data sources. You can feed FormWise PDFs, CSVs, text files, even scrape URLs, and your AI tools will reference that information when generating responses. This is huge for maintaining brand consistency or incorporating proprietary knowledge.

Say you're building tools for a specific industry with specialized terminology. Upload your glossary, style guides, or example outputs. Now every tool in your toolset draws from that knowledge base. You're not just using generic ChatGPT responses. You're getting outputs that reflect your specific expertise and standards.

File upload limits depend on your plan. Pro users get 2MB per file, Agency users get 20MB. That's enough for most documentation, but if you're uploading massive datasets, you might bump into constraints.

**The Theme Builder: Making It Look Like Yours**

Aesthetics matter when you're selling something. FormWise recently rolled out a Theme Builder that lets you customize colors, fonts, logos, and layouts across your tools. You can match your existing brand identity without touching any code.

It's not revolutionary, but it's the difference between "this looks like a generic web form" and "this looks like a polished product we built in-house." When clients interact with your tools, they see your branding consistently. That perception of professionalism matters when you're charging for access.

**What's Missing or Awkward**

No platform is perfect, and FormWise has some quirks. The learning curve isn't zero. If you're expecting to click three buttons and have a finished product, you'll be disappointed. There's a real process of figuring out how to structure prompts, configure inputs, and chain steps together effectively.

The documentation and tutorials have improved significantly, but you'll still spend time experimenting. The Facebook community helps, but you're often figuring things out through trial and error.

Some users mention wishing there were more granular analytics. You can see tool usage and basic metrics, but if you want deep insights into user behavior or conversion funnels, you're exporting data and analyzing elsewhere.

Integration options beyond GoHighLevel are somewhat limited. Yes, you can embed tools via iframe or direct link anywhere, but native integrations with platforms like Kajabi, Circle, or Memberstack aren't as seamless. It's workable, but requires more manual setup.

**Promo Codes and Discounts for 2026**

As of January 2026, there are a few promotional offers floating around. Some affiliate partners are offering discounts on annual plans, occasionally up to 40% off for specific tiers. Code "PERRY40" has been mentioned for 40% off the Agency Annual Plan, and "PERRY20" for 20% off monthly plans, though these might be partner-specific.

Third-party coupon sites list various discount codes ranging from 20% to 75% off, but authenticity varies. Your best bet is checking directly with FormWise or trusted affiliate partners rather than random coupon aggregators.

The 7-day free trial is consistent across plans, so you can test everything before spending money. That trial period is genuinely useful because you'll know pretty quickly whether the platform fits your workflow.

**Real Talk: Is This Actually Worth It?**

If you're already creating AI content for clients manually, FormWise is basically a leverage multiplier. You're taking time you'd spend running prompts and turning it into automated tools people can use repeatedly. The value proposition is pretty straightforward: build once, sell many times.

For agencies specifically, the white-label capabilities and GHL integration make it a solid addition to your service stack. You can charge clients an extra monthly fee for "AI-powered tools" and actually deliver something tangible without hiring developers.

Solo creators and coaches benefit from being able to package their frameworks into always-available resources. Instead of clients waiting for your next call to get answers, they access your AI-powered methodology anytime. That improves client satisfaction and frees up your schedule.

The pricing isn't cheap exactly, but it's reasonable compared to hiring even a junior developer for a few hours. If you generate one additional client from offering AI tools, or upsell a handful of existing clients on a toolset subscription, the ROI math works out quickly.

The biggest question is whether you actually have prompts or frameworks worth packaging. If you're still figuring out your methodology, or your processes are wildly different for each client, productizing might be premature. But if you've got repeatable systems that generate consistent value, FormWise gives you the infrastructure to scale them.

**Getting Started Without Overthinking It**

Here's a practical approach if you're considering this: Start with one tool. Don't try to build an entire toolset ecosystem on day one. Pick the single most valuable thing you do repeatedly for clients and translate that into a SmartForm or CoPilot.

For instance, if you always help clients clarify their value proposition by asking the same five questions, turn that into a SmartForm. Configure the inputs, write the prompt to generate output based on those answers, and test it with a few people.

Once you see that working, build adjacent tools. Maybe a competitor analysis CoPilot, or a pricing strategy SmartForm. Bundle them into a toolset and offer it to your audience as a low-ticket product or bonus for existing clients.

Use the trial period to actually build and test. Don't just poke around the interface. Create something real, even if it's rough, and see how people respond. You'll learn more from one working prototype than hours of planning.

The platform includes template starter packs for common use cases. Start there if you're feeling stuck. Customize someone else's structure rather than staring at a blank canvas.

**The Bottom Line**

FormWise AI sits in an interesting space between DIY ChatGPT usage and hiring a full development team. It's not going to magically turn you into a SaaS founder overnight, but it does genuinely lower the barrier to creating and selling AI-powered tools.

If you're a consultant, coach, or agency owner who's tired of being the bottleneck in your own business, and you've got frameworks or processes that could run on autopilot, this platform gives you the infrastructure to make that happen. The white-label capabilities, monetization features, and GHL integration are legitimately useful for that audience.

Is it perfect? No. Will you need to invest time learning the platform and configuring tools properly? Absolutely. But for people who want to package their expertise into scalable AI products without writing code, FormWise delivers on that promise pretty effectively.

The 7-day trial removes the risk of committing upfront. Build something during that week, show it to a few potential users, and see if the value proposition clicks. If it does, the monthly investment becomes a scaling lever rather than an expense.

For anyone sitting on valuable AI prompts wondering how to turn them into actual products people will pay for, this is worth exploring. Just go in knowing it's a tool that amplifies your existing expertise, not a magic bullet that creates expertise you don't have.
